We handed out plastic bags and gloves so that we could pick up trash along the way to the Seattle Police Officers' Guild (SPOG) headquarters. Once we arrived, we left the bags of trash in front of the building. Music started playing from SPOG headquarters - Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy. Suddenly, with no warning, approximately 30 bike cops came boiling out and slammed into the line. As I was backing away, an officer came at me and maced me directly in the face. The mace soaked my face mask, hair, and neck. It burned my skin, made me cough, and left me disoriented. It took me over 6 hours to get the worst of the mace out of my hair and off my skin.",

At approximately 4 p.m. on Saturday, May 30, 2020, I arrived at Westlake Park to report on the demonstration. The scene was clouded by gas, with protesters scattering. I immediately felt the effects of the gas and began coughing. My eyes stung and watered. Although there did not appear to be any risk of violence from the crowd, law enforcement continued to fire flash bangs and tear gas. I was shocked and frightened by the consistently unprovoked, aggressive use of force by law enforcement officers on multiple different groups of peaceful protesters. There was never any warning before they were deployed.",

On Saturday, May 30, as we reached the intersection of Pine and 5th with our hands up chanting 'hands up, don't shoot' tear gas was deployed. We felt the effects immediately, burning eyes and hard breathing. When the tear gas engulfed me, the words 'I can't breathe' became more than symbolic.

The light and sound emitted from weapons made me feel like I was back in Afghanistan again. The police response felt like a war zone.
